- [ ] Get http://opengameart.org/content/soldier-10 to work. (Blender's Collada exporter is buggy)
    - Runner up test model: http://opengameart.org/content/wizard
- [ ] Terrain shadows from point lights.
    - Separate option.
- [ ] Separate option for spot light terrain shadows.

## Bugs
- [ ] POM with terrains freezes the computer.
- [ ] Lines 48 and 53 in src/graphics/GL/glgputimer.cpp don't work with Mesa3d:
    - GL_INVALID_OPERATION in glQueryCounter(id has an invalid target)
        - Might now be fixed.
- [ ] Forward rendering does not work.
- [ ] The doppler effect (disabled) causes popping noise.
- [ ] More tests should be created.
- [ ] The tesselation test's normals seem incorrect.
- [ ] Circular references will cause memory leaks (scripting).
- [ ] TODOs in src/scripting.
- [ ] Transform::lookAt does not work.
- [ ] Fix black borders around normal mapped metallic objects (http://marmosetco.tumblr.com/post/81245981087 ?):

- [ ] Compiled shaders will be invalidated when a shader is reloaded.

## Other
- [ ] Texture types should be immutable.
- [ ] Benchmarks.
    - [ ] Draw call
    - [ ] AudioWorld
    - [ ] ???
- [ ] Fix banding in darkly lit areas, on metallic surfaces and point light lit areas.
    - [ ] Dithering? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd-Steinberg_dithering?
- [ ] Ambient occlusion looks very bad on spheres.
- [ ] Improve error and exception handling.
- [ ] Get WIP12 running on OpenGL 3.3.
- [ ] SSAO looks bad on curved low-poly faces.
- [ ] Get rid of DECLUNIFORM.
- [ ] Get rid of automatic reloading.

## Performance Improvements
- [ ] Instancing
    - [ ] Implicit
        - [x] G-Buffer
        - [x] Forward
        - [ ] Shadowmap
    - [ ] Explicit
- [ ] SSAO performance should be improved.
- [ ] Fix performance warnings in shaders (Mesa3D):
    - [ ] lightingDirectional.bin:
        - [ ] fragment shader triggered register spilling.  Try reducing the number of live scalar values to improve performance.
        - [ ] SIMD16 shader failed to compile, falling back to SIMD8 at a 10-20% performance cost: FS compile failed: Failure to register allocate.  Reduce number of live scalar values to avoid this.
    - [ ] lightingPoint.bin:
        - [ ] SIMD16 shader failed to compile, falling back to SIMD8 at a 10-20% performance cost: FS compile failed: Failure to register allocate.  Reduce number of live scalar values to avoid this.
    - [ ] lightingSpot.bin:
        - [ ] SIMD16 shader failed to compile, falling back to SIMD8 at a 10-20% performance cost: FS compile failed: Failure to register allocate.  Reduce number of live scalar values to avoid this.
    - [ ] ssaoFragment.bin:
        - [ ] SIMD16 shader failed to compile, falling back to SIMD8 at a 10-20% performance cost: FS compile failed: Failure to register allocate.  Reduce number of live scalar values to avoid this.
- [ ] Improve directional light performance.
    - [ ] Only do deferred shading where deferred objects are rendered.
- [ ] Improve fixed update performance and find out what's not showing up on the renderer CPU timings.
